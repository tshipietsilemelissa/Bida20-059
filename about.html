    <p style="font-size: 21 px;"><b style="color: #009688;"> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 31px;">HISTORY</h1></b><br>Is the capitaland largest metropolis of South Korea. Seoul was the capital of various Korean states, including Baekje, Joseon, the Korean Empire, Goryeo (as a secondary capital), and presently South Korea. Strategically located along the Han River, Seoul's history stretches back over two thousand years, when it was founded in 18 BC by the people of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The city was later designated the capital of Korea under the Joseon dynasty. Seoul is surrounded by a mountainous and hilly landscape,
        with Bukhan Mountain located on the northern edge of the city.The history of the city of Seoul dates back approximately 2,000 years, to when Wiryeseong, the capital of Baekje, was located on the banks of the Hangang River in the southeastern part of what is now Seoul.
        Development of the city began in earnest once it was appointed the capital of the Joseon Dynasty (1392 - 1910) in 1394.
        The framework for modern-day Seoul began to emerge as the construction of electrical facilities, railroads, streetcar tracks, parks, waterworks systems, schools, and hospitals commenced at the end of the 19th century with the opening of the port. However, Seoul soon came under the influence of Japanese colonialism (1910 - 1945).</p><br>

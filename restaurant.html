    <img src="images/Layeon.jpg" style="height: 295px; width: 360px; float: left; padding: 20px;" alt="La Yeon">
    <h1 style="color: #009688; padding: 20px;">La Yeon</h1><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">  It came as no surprise to anyone when La Yeon received three stars in the first Michelin Guide to Seoul. Its interpretation of traditional Korean cuisine cooked to perfection using modern techniques is thought to have elevated Korean cuisine to a whole level: Think charcoal-grilled eel with gochujang sauce or steamed red snapper with red-pepper sauce. Located on the 23rd floor of the Shilla Seoul Hotel, La Yeon also provides diners a scenic view over the city. With delicate flavors and impeccable service, La Yeon is a leading fine dining destination in Seoul.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <img src="images/Dooreyoo.jpg" style="height: 295px; width: 360px; float: left; padding: 20px;" alt="Dooreyoo">
    <h1 style="color: #009688; padding: 20px;">Doore Yoo</h1><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Michelin-starred chef Tony Yoo found a new home in the heart of Bukchon Hanok Village, a neighborhood filled with traditional Korean houses. In a calming Hanok setting, Yoo combines temple cuisine — a vegetable-centered cuisine that originated in Korea’s Buddhist temples — and traditional Korean dishes to create an elegant modern Korean cuisine of his own. There’s a chaejip (foraging) menu using ingredients found across Korea available if requested a couple days in advance.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <img src="images/Mokmyeoksanbang.jpg" style="height: 295px; width: 360px; float: left; padding: 20px;" alt="Mokmeoksanbang">
    <h1 style="color: #009688; padding: 20px;">Mokmeoksanbang</h1><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Most tourists visiting Seoul plan to ride cable cars to the top of Namsan (Nam Mountain) to take in the scenic view. Not too far from the entrance to the cable cars hides a beautiful traditional Korean house that is also a restaurant. Named after Namsan's old name, Mokmeoksan, Mokmeoksanbang serves one of the city’s best versions of bibimbap, a rice bowl topped with meat, eggs, and fresh produce sourced from farmers all around the country.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    

    <img src="images/Kwangjang.jpg" style="height: 295px; width: 360px; float: left; padding: 20px;" alt="Kwangjang">
    <h1 style="color: #009688; padding: 20px;">Gwangjang Market</h1><br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Step inside the Gwangjang Market if you want to get lost in Korean street-food paradise. Gwangjang is Korea's largest hanbok (traditional clothing) and textile market, but it also happens to be the oldest street-food market in the country, filled with food stalls boasting a wide array of street-food offerings. The smells, sights, and vibrant energy will work up your appetite. See something you like? Just grab a seat and start ordering. Don't forget to save some room for yukhoe (a Korean beef tartare with sesame oil and Asian pear) and bindaeddeok (fried mung bean pancakes).</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
